# Nimble Natter Network

## Overview

The **Nimble Natter Network** is a lightweight, JavaFX-based networking application designed to facilitate seamless communication between multiple clients and servers. Built with modularity and scalability in mind, this project showcases essential networking concepts using JavaFX for a modern and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Establish and manage connections between multiple clients and servers.
- **Secure Communication**: Includes password-protected server access for added security.
- **Dynamic UI**: Responsive and intuitive JavaFX-based user interface.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Observable lists and real-time client management.
- **LAN Discovery**: Automatically discover servers on the local network for quick and easy connections.
- **Key-Based Responses**: Servers respond dynamically to client requests using a flexible key-based mechanism.
- **Port Scanning**: Integrated functionality to scan ports dynamically and connect to available servers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17 or newer**: Ensure you have JavaFX bundled or installed separately.
- **Maven or Gradle**: For dependency management and building the project.
- **Local Network Access**: For utilizing LAN discovery and real-time communication.

## Usage

1. Launch the application and create a new server by entering:
   - **Meeting ID**: A unique identifier for the session.
   - **Password**: A secure key to join the server.
2. Join the server as a client by entering the meeting ID and password.
3. Automatically discover available servers on the local network using the LAN discovery feature.
4. Manage connected clients in real-time via the intuitive interface.

## Architecture

The Nimble Natter Network employs a modular and scalable architecture designed to facilitate smooth communication between clients and servers:

- **Server Component**:
  - Accepts incoming client connections.
  - Manages session details using Meeting IDs and passwords.
  - Handles message broadcasts and client-specific responses.
  - Utilizes threading to support multiple simultaneous client connections.

- **Client Component**:
  - Connects to a server by providing valid Meeting ID and password.
  - Sends and receives messages in real-time.
  - Handles errors gracefully during connection or message transmission.

- **Control Unit**:
  - Manages the interaction between the UI and the networking logic.
  - Implements logic to create new servers or join existing ones.
  - Bridges server discovery, client connection, and messaging functionality.

- **Messenger**:
  - Manages message validation and synchronization between clients.
  - Keeps track of active client sockets and maintains session consistency.
